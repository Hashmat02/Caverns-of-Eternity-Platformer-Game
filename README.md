Game title: Caverns of Eternity

Game genre: Platformer, Puzzle, Adventure, Exploration

Game Concept
Control an “Indiana Jones”/”Lara Croft”-esque character, who enters a network of caves filled with magical crystals and laden with puzzles and traps, in hopes of finding the legendary Crystal of Youth.
Mechanics for each level include those inspired from the game “Fireboy & Watergirl”, such as levers and weight buttons to activate and disable traps, including moving blocks onto said buttons to maintain the weight. The traps can range from anything like spikes all the way to lava. Light ray activated puzzles can also be implemented, (play “Fireboy & Watergirl” for reference). The door at the end of each level has its own final mechanic, elaborated on below. In order to unlock the final door you have to solve one last puzzle.
Door Mechanics (potential options – subject to change):
Snake, where you have to beat a set high score with limited attempts.
Maze with limited moves.
Riddle with limited tries.
Exceeding the limited number of attempts/moves results in player death (through trap trigger) and restarting of the level/game depending on the base concept (roguelike or vanilla).

Unique selling points
How is this game different from competing products?
Historical Influence: While games like Tomb Raider and Uncharted have historical elements, Caverns of Eternity integrates mechanisms from various points in history, blending old-fashioned levers with modern-day computer puzzles, providing a unique juxtaposition of eras. Additionally, the Crystal of Youth serves as a singular, powerful motivation, creating a focused narrative drive compared to broader treasure-hunting plots.

What new concepts does it introduce?
Using reflective surfaces and light manipulation to solve puzzles, adding a unique visual and interactive element. 
Combining traditional traps like spikes and lava with more complex mechanisms such as collapsing platforms and timed sequences.
Incorporating well-known games like Snake, players encounter a final door in each level. To progress to the next level, they must successfully complete a mini-game challenge presented at this door, adding an extra layer of excitement and variety to the gameplay experience. 

What special moves or combos does the player have?
Dashing: A quick burst of speed to avoid traps or cover short distances quickly.
Shield Activation: Temporarily protects the player from certain traps or hazards.
Advanced Climbing: Enhanced climbing abilities to navigate complex vertical sections of the caves.
The Crystal Rebirth is a powerful super move that allows the player to set a custom respawn point anywhere in the level by collecting and activating a special crystal.

Does the game use a special art style?
The art style of Caverns of Eternity is realistic pixel art, blending the nostalgic charm of pixel graphics with detailed, lifelike elements. This art style reflects the broader game setting as it aims to blend the retro pixel theme with the modern high resolution graphics. It also aims to create an immersive and visually appealing environment while maintaining the simplicity and clarity of pixel art.
High-Resolution Pixel Overlay: Utilize higher resolution overlays for the pixel art to allow for greater detail and smoother animations.
Texture Work: Apply realistic textures to surfaces, such as rocky cave walls, glowing crystals, and ancient machinery, giving them a tangible, lifelike appearance.
Lighting and Shadows: Implement static lighting, utilize overlay effects like vignetting and ambient occlusion, along with particle effects such as dust and light rays. (Particle effects should not be computationally expensive). 


Player’s role and goals
The player controls a retired raider named “Lara Jones” (styled after the likes of “Indiana Jones”, and “Lara Croft”). Having left the raiding world to live a life of peace, they’ve been diagnosed with a severe illness with no known cure, and to fight it, they once more take up the old mantle and make their way down the famed Crystal Caverns.  Along the way, the player collects crystals to open routes through the caverns, and at the end obtains the Crystal of Youth to cure his illness.
Player’s emotions
The game aims to provide players with a challenging experience that stimulates critical thinking through progressively harder puzzles, scaling in difficulty with the player's skill level linearly. It seeks to evoke a mix of stress and exhilaration, while strategically incorporating moments of relaxation to maintain a continuous flow state. By weaving in peaks and valleys of intensity, the game prevents monotony, keeping players engaged as they navigate high-stakes settings, particularly towards the climax where failure prompts a level restart. This rollercoaster of challenge and reward ensures a dynamic and immersive gameplay experience.
